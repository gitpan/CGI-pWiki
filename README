The CGI::pWiki class is implementating the WikiWikiWeb idea of a
user elaboratable database written in Perl and published at CPAN.

Goal of CGI::pWiki is to provide a framework to enable large groups
of authors to contribute content to a website.

The CGI::pWiki acts as an Apache-Handler translating content from
WikiWikiWeb to HTML adding style templates, if wanted. The CGI::pWiki
knows about some additional file formats besides Wiki. So one can
use text/plain, text/html text/pod and text/xml, also.

Normal users will only generate GET events with browsing and searching,
while authors generate POST events for editing and saving. So simple
htaccess files could be used to restrict authorship of directories.
