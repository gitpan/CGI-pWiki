<wiki title="Query Strings">

Each location can be extended by one of the [query_string]s :

| query | method | display |
| ?error | get | error message |
| ?diff | get | context diff since last commit |
| ?search=pattern | get | search the database |
| ?edit | post | edit form |
| ?save | post | save form |

The post events require user authentication at most sites.
