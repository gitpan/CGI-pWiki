The original WikiWikiWeb was written by Ward Cunningham
of the portland pattern repository.

A version of it was studied by Markus Peter and is
maintained by him at the http://jos.org/ site.

That version was modified by
<a href=http://mozilla.devel.org/noreg/moz/people.cgi/BobRacko>Bob Racko</a>
for the KeheiWiki and was studied by me.

I wanted a real Perl Module - so I wrote one.
