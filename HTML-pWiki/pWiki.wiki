[pWiki] is an inplementation of the WikiWikiWeb idea of
a user elaboratable database written in Perl and published
at CPAN.

Everything you see is somewhere in a database.
All access to the database is done through a handler
used to retrieve or update this data.
The screens are translated depending on the file_type,
when retrieved from the database.
Each location in the pWiki can be extended by a
query_string.
